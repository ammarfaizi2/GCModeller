    ''' A local heap is a collection of small pieces of data that are particular to a single object 
    ''' in the HDF5 file. Objects can be inserted and removed from the heap at any time. The 
    ''' address of a heap does not change once the heap is created. For example, a group stores 
    ''' addresses of objects in symbol table nodes with the names of links stored in the group's 
    ''' local heap.
